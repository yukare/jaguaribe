    Jaguaribe is an image browser writtem in java, is an application to view
images and folders with images.

    Why another image program?
    There are lots of programs to view images, but most of it provides the same
functions and there some functions that i want to implement because i want it
and do not know c++. Since i want to learn java, i started by making something
i want.
    Windows have some good image applications, but most of then are with closed
source code and Linux really need some good program to see images, as about all
image programs are very simple. There is none program for Linux with a good
slideshow feature.

    Keyboard Shortcuts
    Some time in the future will have a window to change the preferences like
the actions for the keyboard, but current this is not developed, so the default
keyboard is:
Left arrow -> Previous image
Rigth arrow -> Next image
Up arrow -> Previous folder
Down arrow -> Next folder
F11 -> fullscreen mode on/off

    Planned Features
    This is a small list of features i want in the program, maybe it increase
latter, but now i want a small set of it that works well.
* Multiplataform (Current developed on Windows and Linux)
* Easy to use
* Slideshow, and the ability to continue on in it in the last view image.
